(a) Make a class Employee with a name and salary. Override the
toString method so that, when applied to an object e of Employee,
it returns the string
Employee[name=#1, salary=#2]
where #1 and #2 are the name and the salary of e, respectively.
*/

/* Q1
(b) Make a class Manager that extends Employee. Add an instance
field, named department, of type String. Supply a method
toString that prints the managerâ€™s name, department, and salary.
*/

/* Q1
(c) Make a class Executive that extends Manager. Supply the ap-
propriate toString method.
*/

(d) Supply a test program that tests these classes and methods.

/* Q2
Define the following functions in Scala and use its interpreter to test
that each of them is well-defined.
(a) factors : (n:Int)List[Int] that, for any n, returns the list
of factors of n.
(b) prime : (n:Int)Boolean that decides whether the input is a
prime number.
(c) primes : (n:Int)List[Int] that, for any n, returns the list of
the prime numbers that are less than or equal to n.
(Hint: Use for-comprehension to define (2a) and (2c).)
*/

/* Q3
Write a program that prompts the user for an integer, reads it, and
then prints out all prime numbers up to that integer. (Hint: You
may use readInt and println to read an integer and print a line,
respectively.)
