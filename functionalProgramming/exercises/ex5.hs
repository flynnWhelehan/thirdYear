-- 1. Without looking at the Prelude, define the following functions
{-
a. all :: (a→Bool) → [Bool] → Bool, which decides if all elements of a
list satisfy a predicate.
-}

{-
b. takeWhile :: (a→Bool) → [a] → [a], which selects elements from a
list while they satisfy a predicate.

2. Without looking at the Prelude, define the function curry that converts a
function on pairs into a curried function.
