Covers both theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, with Python as the programming language.

## Learning outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge of the theoretical background in machine learning methods.
Have an understanding of the main advantages and limitations of various approaches to machine learning and specific machine-learning algorithms.
Be able to implement versions of several machine-learning algorithms.
Have an understanding of some ways to apply the ideas and algorithms of machine learning in industry, medicine and other fields.

## Textbooks
The main textbook for this course is:

- Andreas C. Mueller and Sarah Guido. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python. O'Reilly Media, 2016.

The textbooks covering the theory of general machine learning for this course are:

- Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, Second edition. Springer, 2021.
- Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. The Elements of Statistical Learning, Second edition. Springer, 2009.
  - The first book is a simplified version of the second. The college library has many copies of both books (519.5 JAM and 006.31 HAS). You can download the pdf files from the James et al.'s book's web site and Hastie et al.'s book web site.

An important part of this course is conformal prediction, a technique for assessing reliability of predictions in machine learning. Two books on this topic are:

- Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, Shen-Shyang Ho, and Vladimir Vovk (editors). Conformal prediction for reliable machine learning. Elsevier, 2014.
- Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer. Algorithmic learning in a random world. Springer, 2005. (Second edition is to appear in October 2022.)
  - The first book is more accessible than the second and describes practical applications. The first book is available at the RHUL library via Safari Books Online, and the second is available in hard copy (518.3 VOV).
